# Data-Augmentation
Comparing classification accuracies using different neural network architectures (ResNet-50, VGG-19, Inception-v3, and a custom one) and two remote sensing datasets 
(SAT-6 and UCMerced). 

Comparison of:__
1 - No augmentation__
2 - Generic augmentation (cropping, rotatinon, flipping, etc.)__
3 - Cross-correlation-based simulation algoright__

SAT-6 data is located within its respective folder,
Due to data size, UCMerced dataset is stored in OneDrive: https://uwy-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tdavydze_uwyo_edu/EUxXOD1yQ59FmDQNoEnemGsB0in4Li1wViqt6PISuHE73A?e=TJ7jnt
