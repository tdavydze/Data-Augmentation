# Data-Augmentation
Comparing classification accuracies using different neural network architectures (ResNet-50, VGG-19, Inception-v3, and a custom one) and two remote sensing datasets 
(SAT-6 and UCMerced). 

Comparing:  
1 - No augmentation  
2 - Generic augmentation (cropping, rotatinon, flipping, etc.)  
3 - Cross-correlation-based simulation algoright  

SAT-6 data is located within its respective folder,  
Due to data size, UCMerced dataset is stored in OneDrive:
